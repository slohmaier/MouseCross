# MouseCross - Mac App Store Submission Guide

This guide documents all scripts and processes for submitting MouseCross to the Mac App Store. Each script serves a specific purpose in the build, sign, and submission pipeline.

## Overview

The Mac App Store submission process involves several scripts working together to:
1. Build the application with proper App Store configuration
2. Code sign the application and create installer packages
3. Register Bundle IDs and create App Store Connect records
4. Upload the signed package to App Store Connect

## Required Scripts Analysis

### ‚úÖ Core Build Scripts (Required)

#### `build_appstore.sh` - **REQUIRED**
**Purpose**: Builds MouseCross specifically for App Store submission with proper configuration.

**What it does**:
- Cleans previous builds and creates fresh build directory
- Configures CMake with `APPSTORE_BUILD=ON` for universal binary (x86_64 + arm64)
- Uses static Qt path: `/Users/stefan/Qt/6.9.0/macos`
- Runs `macdeployqt` to bundle Qt libraries
- Creates unsigned App Store package: `MouseCross-0.1.0-appstore.pkg`

**When to use**: First step in App Store submission process
```bash
./build_appstore.sh
```

#### `submit_appstore.sh` - **REQUIRED**
**Purpose**: Complete code signing and upload to App Store Connect.

**What it does**:
- Validates environment, certificates, and provisioning profile
- Creates proper entitlements file (sandbox + file access only)
- Signs all Qt frameworks, plugins, and the main executable
- Embeds Mac App Store provisioning profile for TestFlight compatibility
- Signs app bundle with entitlements and provisioning profile
- Creates signed installer package
- Uploads to App Store Connect using `altool`

**Configuration**:
- Team ID: `9KDRP4Q2D3`
- Apple ID: `stefan@slohmaier.de`
- Bundle ID: `de.slohmaier.mousecross`

**Usage**:
```bash
# Full process (sign + upload)
./submit_appstore.sh

# Sign only
./submit_appstore.sh --sign-only

# Upload only (if already signed)
./submit_appstore.sh --upload-only
```

### ‚úÖ Certificate Management Scripts (Required for First-Time Setup)

#### `create_csrs.sh` - **REQUIRED (One-time)**
**Purpose**: Creates Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) for Mac App Store distribution certificates.

**What it does**:
- Generates private keys and CSRs for both App and Installer certificates
- Provides instructions for uploading CSRs to Apple Developer Portal
- Creates: `MouseCross_App_Certificate.certSigningRequest` and `MouseCross_Installer_Certificate.certSigningRequest`

**When to use**: Only once, when setting up certificates for the first time

#### `install_certificates.sh` - **REQUIRED (One-time)**
**Purpose**: Installs downloaded certificates from Apple into the keychain.

**What it does**:
- Installs Mac App Store distribution certificates
- Verifies certificate installation
- Checks keychain access permissions

**When to use**: After downloading certificates from Apple Developer Portal

#### `create_provisioning_profile.sh` - **REQUIRED (One-time)**
**Purpose**: Guides through creating Mac App Store provisioning profile for TestFlight.

**What it does**:
- Opens Apple Developer Portal in browser
- Provides step-by-step instructions for provisioning profile creation
- Validates downloaded provisioning profile
- Creates: `MouseCross_Mac_App_Store.provisionprofile`

**When to use**: One-time setup for TestFlight compatibility (fixes ITMS-90889 error)

**When to use**: One-time setup when creating the App Store Connect app record

#### `auto_create_app.sh` - **DEPRECATED**
**Status**: ‚ùå Not working reliably
**Purpose**: Attempted to automate App Store Connect app creation via AppleScript.

**Issues**:
- Browser automation unreliable
- App Store Connect interface changes break automation
- Manual process more reliable

**Recommendation**: Use `register_app_complete.sh` instead
