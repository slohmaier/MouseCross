# How to Rebuild MouseCross - LGPL Compliance Guide

MouseCross is free and open source software licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3.0 or later. This guide explains how users can rebuild MouseCross from source code to comply with LGPL requirements.

## What is LGPL Compliance?

The LGPL (Lesser General Public License) ensures that users have the right to:
- **Access source code** of the software
- **Modify the software** according to their needs

## Step-by-Step Rebuild Instructions

### 1. Obtain the Source Code

MouseCross source code is available on GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slohmaier/MouseCross.git
cd MouseCross
```

**Alternative**: Download the source code as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository and extract it.

### 2. Platform-Specific Build Instructions

#### macOS Build

##### Regular Build (for direct distribution):
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure the build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/Users/$(whoami)/Qt/6.9.0/macos" ..
# Or for Homebrew Qt: cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@6" ..

# Build the application
cmake --build . --config Release

# The app bundle will be created at: build/MouseCross.app
```

##### App Store Compliant Build:
```bash
# Use the dedicated App Store build script
cd deployment/macos
./build_appstore.sh

# The bundled app will be created at: dist/MouseCross.app
```

#### Windows Build

##### x64 Build:
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure for x64
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Qt\6.5.0\msvc2022_64" ..

# Build the application
cmake --build . --config Release

# The executable will be at: build\Release\MouseCross.exe
```

##### ARM64 Build:
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure for ARM64
cmake -A ARM64 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Qt\6.5.0\msvc2022_arm64" ..

# Build the application
cmake --build . --config Release

# The executable will be at: build\Release\MouseCross.exe
```

##### Windows Deployment Packages:
MouseCross provides several Windows deployment options:

```bash
# Portable ZIP (no installation required)
cd deployment\windows
build_portable.bat

# MSI Installer (for WinGet and enterprise)
build_msi.bat

# MSIX Package (for Microsoft Store)
build_msix.bat

# Simple build (basic executable with dependencies)
build_simple.bat
```

#### Linux Build

```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian example)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev cmake build-essential git

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure the build
cmake ..

# Build the application
cmake --build . --config Release

# The executable will be at: build/MouseCross
```

## Build Verification

After building, you can verify your build works correctly:

### macOS:
```bash
# Test the app bundle
./build/MouseCross.app/Contents/MacOS/MouseCross

# Or for App Store build:
./dist/MouseCross.app/Contents/MacOS/MouseCross
```

### Windows:
```bash
# Test the executable
.\build\Release\MouseCross.exe
```

### Linux:
```bash
# Test the executable
./build/MouseCross
```

## Customization Options

The LGPL license allows you to modify MouseCross. Here are some common customization points:

### Build Configuration Options:
- **APPSTORE_BUILD=ON**: Enable App Store-specific features (macOS only)
- **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug**: Build with debug information
- **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release**: Build optimized release version

### Source Code Modifications:
All source code is located in the `src/` directory:
- **User interface**: `*Dialog.cpp` files
- **Crosshair rendering**: `CrosshairRenderer.cpp`, `CrosshairOverlay.cpp`
- **Settings management**: `SettingsManager.cpp`
- **System integration**: `AutoStart.cpp`

### Icon and Resource Customization:
- **Application icon**: `resources/icons/app_icon.svg`
- **UI resources**: `resources/resources.qrc`
- **Translations**: `translations/` directory

## License Compliance Notes
